            <p>We try to be as clear as possible when it comes to ethics and our reporting. We are a completely independent website owned wholly by Liam Dawe.</p>
            
            <h2>Do you take payment in return for an article?</h2>
            
            <p>Hell no! We will never take a payment in return for an article. We get emails every single week, often daily, asking for an article to be put up in exchange for a payment&mdash;they go right into our spam folder.</p>
            
            <h2>Game Keys & Hardware</h2>
            
            <p>We do often receive keys for games from a publisher or a developer. This is not in return for a good review, but so we can actually write about it.</p>
            <p>We will never, ever, give a game or hardware a good review in return for a key. We write how we personally feel about it, nothing more.</p>
            <p>Disclosure is important, so if we haven't disclosed we got a game key for free when writing a review of a game or hardware, please let us know ASAP so we can correct it!</p>
            
            <h2>Affiliate Links</h2>
            
            <p>We do sometimes include affiliate links, it's usually mentioned when we do. We are currently an affiliate with the game store Fanatical.</p>
