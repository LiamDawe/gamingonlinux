			<p>You can contact us any time using this email: <a href="mailto:contact@gamingonlinux.com" target="_top">contact@gamingonlinux.com</a>. This goes direct to the owner, Liam Dawe. Please do get in touch if you're concerned with anything, or if you feel we need to update this page.</p>
            
            <p>Your privacy is extremely important to us, so please read this and be aware of it. We firmly believe that user privacy and data protection are human rights. We find the amount of data collected by some big websites as crazy as you do!</p>
            <p>We will <strong>never</strong> sell any personal information collected first-hand to third parties. We do <strong>not</strong> have any external adverts that track you either. We will also <strong>never</strong> buy any information to include in our database (you will never find your email in our Mailing List for example, unless you specifically opt-in).</p>
            
            <h2>Cookies</h2>

            <p>Cookies are small files stored on your computer by your web browser (such as Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) at the request of a site you're viewing.

            <p>Cookies may be stored on your computer for a short time (such as only while your browser is open) or for an extended period of time, even years. Cookies not set by this site will not be accessible to us.</p>
            
            <h3>Our Cookie Usage</h3>

				<li>One cookie to remember your username on our login form. Only if you tick the box, this is opt-in.</li>
				<li>One cookie as a security measure, to identify the system you're logging into the website with. This way, if we detect a login where this cookie does not exist, it will be a new device using your account. It's so we can email you, to let you know a new device logged into your account. This can be completely turned off in your User Control Panel under the "Notification Preferences" page.</li>
