            <p>Your privacy is extremely important to us, so please read this and be aware of it. We firmly believe that user privacy and data protection are human rights. We find the amount of data collected by some big websites as crazy as you do!</p>
            <p>We will <strong>never</strong> sell or share any personal information collected first-hand to third parties. We do <strong>not</strong> have any external adverts that track you either. We will also <strong>never</strong> buy any information to include in our database (you will never find your email in our Mailing List for example, unless you specifically opt-in).</p>

					</ul> 
				<li>In either case, once accepted or denied your email address is then removed in relation to that article. You can give us any username for it to be published under, you can even leave that field blank to be called a "Guest".</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>For additional privacy, we always recommend seeking out extra privacy plugins for your browser! They exist for a reason.</p>
